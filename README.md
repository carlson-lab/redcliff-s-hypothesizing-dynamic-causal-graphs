## Repository Overview

**_Modules_**:
 - data: contains scripts, functions, and class definitions for handling data used in [1]
 - evaluate: contains scripts and functions used to obtain results reported in [1]
 - models: contains class definitions for each algorithm/method used in [1]
 - general_utils: contains general purpose functions used to support modules in the repo
 - tidybench: a locally adapted copy of the original tidybench repository [2]
 - train: contains scripts for training algorithms/baselines described in [1]


**_Naming Conventions_**:
 - Training Scripts: generally formatted as "algName_datasetName_uniqueScriptIdentifier", along with either ".py" for the actual python script or "_cached_args.txt" to denote a file that contains the hyperparameters for the script
